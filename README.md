# CSV_Cleaner_Template
This GitHub repository contains a Python script designed to cleans CSV files by removing commas from cell values and replacing backslashes (\) with forward slashes (/). It processes all .csv files in a specified folder, creating a cleaned version of each file with _clean appended to the filename, while preserving the original files.
